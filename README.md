What is WNBD?
-------------

WNBD is a client side implementation of [Network Block Device](https://nbd.sourceforge.io/)

Prerequisites
-------------

  * [Release](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/aserdean/wnbd/artifacts/wnbd-Release.zip?job=Configuration%3A+Release)

How to install
--------------

* **Prerequisites**.

  After building, the driver is automatically test signed. To install the built driver you must make sure that your target machine is Test Signed enabled first.
  To enable Test Signing on your target machine, please issue the following from an elevated command prompt:
  ```
  > bcdedit.exe /set testsigning yes
  ```
  Please note that you can enable driver signing only if Secure Boot is not enabled on the target machine.
  To check if your target machine does not have Secure Boot enabled issue `Confirm-SecureBootUEFI` from an elevated powershell prompt
  ```
  PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> Confirm-SecureBootUEFI
  False
  ```
  **A reboot is required after changing `bcdedit` settings**

* **Installation/removal**.

  We require [devcon.exe](https://cloudbase.it/downloads/devcon.exe) utility to install and uninstall the driver.

  * To **install** the driver issue the following from an elevated command prompt:
    ```
    > .\devcon.exe install .\wnbd.inf root\wnbd
    ```
  (The command above assumes that the utility `devcon.exe` and the driver files `wnbd.inf`, `wnbd.cat`, `wnbd.sys` are in the current directory)

  * To **uninstall** the driver issue the following from an elevated command prompt:
    ```
    .\devcon.exe remove "root\wnbd"
    ```
  (The command above assumes that the utility `devcon.exe` is in the current directory)

  For convenience, we included <a href="vstudio/reinstall.ps1">reinstall.ps1</a> which uninstalls (ignoring the error) and installs the driver again.

Ceph integration
----------------

Mapping and umapping RBD images is straighforward, just use [rbd-nbd](https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/man/8/rbd-nbd/), part of the [Ceph Windows port](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/34859).

    rbd-nbd map img1
    rbd-nbd unmap img1

Testing with NBD (Network Block Device)
---------------------------------------

Please note that the following is not needed for Ceph and is mostly intended to be used in development scenarios.

We assume you are familiar with <a href="https://github.com/NetworkBlockDevice/nbd#using-nbd">using NBD</a>.

  * `wnbd-client` syntax
  ```
  PS C:\workspace> .\wnbd-client.exe
  Syntax:
  wnbd-client map  <InstanceName> <HostName> <PortName> <ExportName> <DoNotNegotiate>
  wnbd-client unmap <InstanceName>
  wnbd-client list
  ```

  * NBD server configuration:
  ```
  root@ubuntu-Virtual-Machine:/home/ubuntu# cat /etc/nbd-server/config
  [generic]
  # If you want to run everything as root rather than the nbd user, you
  # may either say "root" in the two following lines, or remove them
  # altogether. Do not remove the [generic] section, however.
          port = 10809
          user = nbd
          group = nbd
          includedir = /etc/nbd-server/conf.d

  # What follows are export definitions. You may create as much of them as
  # you want, but the section header has to be unique.

  [foo]
      exportname = /image/path.img
      port = 10809
      copyonwrite = true
  root@ubuntu-Virtual-Machine:/home/ubuntu# ifconfig eth0 | grep 172
          inet 172.17.160.251  netmask 255.255.255.240  broadcast 172.17.160.255
  ```

  * Mapping an export:
  ```
  PS C:\workspace> .\wnbd-client.exe map test2 172.17.160.251 10809 foo
  InstanceName=test2
  HostName=172.17.160.251
  PortName=10809
  ExportName=foo
  MustNegociate=1

  ```

  * Listing the mapped device
  ```
  PS C:\workspace> .\wnbd-client.exe list
  Status: 0
  InstanceName    Pid     DiskNumber
  test2           6712            1

  * Unmapping the device
  ```
  PS C:\workspace> .\wnbd-client.exe unmap test2
  PS C:\workspace> Get-Disk
